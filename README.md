# PonderNet-TensorFlow

This is an unofficial implementation of the paper: [PonderNet: Learning to Ponder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05407) in TensorFlow.

PonderNet adapts the computation based on the input. It changes the number of steps to take on a recurrent network based on the input. PonderNet learns this with end-to-end gradient descent.
